Introduction

	This library has been copied from http://code.google.com/p/python-linkedin/
	
	The reason why I copied this library here because it has a lot of bugs and issues and the original code is not being maintained since 2010.
	
	

VERSION 1.8.2:
    - You can now use get_profile(fields=['recommendations-received']) and iterate through all recommendations
